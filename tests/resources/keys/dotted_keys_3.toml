# This makes the key "fruit" into a table.
fruit.apple.smooth = true

# So then you can add to the table "fruit" like so:
fruit.orange = 2

# THE FOLLOWING IS INVALID

# This defines the value of fruit.apple to be an integer.
fruit.apple = 1

# But then this treats fruit.apple like it's a table.
# You can't turn an integer into a table.
fruit.apple.smooth = true
