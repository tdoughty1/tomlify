Expected output can be easily parsed by running:

uv run src/tomlify/lexer/lex_runner.py tests/resources/<path_to_toml> | sed 's/^/        "/' | sed 's/$/",/' > tokens.txt

Then copy and paste into the integration test. This will assume the output is correct, so you can make small changes as necessary.

Currently, this does not correct for raw newline and string delimiter issues that need to be fixed by hand
